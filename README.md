# asuro-environment

Asuro is a cheap little programmable robot. This repository contains libasuro, which may be partly modified to the specific characteristics of my asuro model. It also contains my projects in the example folder (for convenience reasons aka lazyness). I currently use Codelite to program, so there is also a Codelite workspace and project files.

The COPYING, AUTHORS and the CHANGELOG file belongs to libasuro (aka asurolib). There may come structural changes to properly distinguish libasuro from my additions and programs.

## what you need

In short, you basically need:

- avr-gcc (gcc-avr on ubuntu)
- avr-libc, avr-binutils, make, ...
- libasuro and applications (this repository)
- con\_flash or another flasher application for your asuro robot.
