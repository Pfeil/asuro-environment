# asuro-environment

Asuro is a cheap little programmable robot. This repository contains libasuro, which may be partly modified to the specific characteristics of my asuro model. It also contains my projects in the example folder (for convenience reasons aka lazyness). I currently use Codelite to program, so there is also a Codelite workspace and project files.

The LICENSE file belongs to libasuro (aka asurolib).

## what you need

In short, you basically need:

- avr-gcc (or gcc-avr)
- avr-libc, avr-binutils, make, ...
- libasuro and applications (this repository)
- con\_flash or another flasher application for your asuro robot.
